## Impacts on Human Communities

Note: Some of this text was revised in Word around Sept 7 (See email from Deirdre : updated eco impacts).  These have not been integrated into this document. 

### Action 1 - Rebuilding Plan
The general approach used in this analysis is to describe the discounted projected revenues under the different rebuilding alternatives and recruitment assumptions. To do this:

1.  Landings are assumed to be equal to the projected ABCs described in section 6.1. 
1.  Predict prices corresponding to that level of landings using the results of a simple  model of prices. 
1.  Multiply price by landings to construct revenue.
1.  Discount by 7\% or 3\% per year as mandated by OMB Circular A-4.
1.  Sum up the discounted yearly revenue.

A projection of ABCs under Alterative 1 is difficult. As described in section 4.1.1, NEFMC would continue to use the ABC control rule to set fishery specifications two years at a time.  This is assumed to would produce the same set of ABCs as Alternative 2.

#### Prices\label{sec:prices}

<!-- 
D asked for a less technical overview of this 
-->
Annual herring landings and price data from 2003-2020 to estimate a relationship between prices and landings.   Prices are normalized to 2019 real US dollars using the GDP implicit price deflator.  Prices per metric ton and landings are expressed in thousands of metric tons.  The first column of Table \ref{regression_results} contains the model of prices that are used to predict future prices^[A least-squares regression will be produce biased estimates if prices and quantities are simultaneously determined.  An Instrumental Variables estimator, where previous year's landings is used as an instrument for landings, can overcome this problem.  A pair of log-transformed models are also estimated. The first column is the preferred specification and used for predictions. The other three columns are presented as robustness checks.   The log-landings coefficient from the IV model is an elasticity and implies that an increase in landings of 1\% will reduce prices by 0.44\%.].  Based on the econometric model of prices, predicted prices and revenues are calcluated according to:

\begin{align}
\mbox{Predicted Price} &= 815 - 5.893*\mbox{landings}\label{eq:predicted_price}\\
\mbox{Predicted Revenue} &=  (815 - 5.893*\mbox{landings}) *\mbox{landings}\label{eq:predicted_landings}
\end{align}

The landings coefficient implies that, on average, an increase in landings of 1,000 mt will reduce prices by \$5.89 per metric ton.  The predicted revenue equation is quadratic in landings.  According to this model of prices, the maximum revenue is approximately \$28M, which occurs at landings of approximately 69,000mt.  Increases in landings beyond this point will decrease gross revenues.  See figure \ref{fig:predicted_rev} below for a graphical illustration.


```{r predicted_rev, fig.show = "hold", out.width = "75%", fig.cap="Relationship Between Landings and Predicted Revenue",  fig.align = "center", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(my_images,c("graph_predicted_rev.png")))
```


The methods used to model prices are slighly different that those used in Deroba *et al* (2019).  In Deroba *et al* (2019), an autoregressive distributed lag model was used.  The authors find that the an increase in landings of 1,000 mt will reduce prices by \$1.19 per metric to; alternatively, an increase in landings of 1\% will reduce prices by 0.395\%.  Note that the elasticity estimates in Deroba *et al* (2019) are comparable to elasticities in Table \ref{regression_results}.

In Amendment 8, an elasticity of -0.50 was assumed. By coincidence, this assumption turned out to be fairly close to both the estimates in Deroba *et al* (2019) and the estimates in columns 3 and 4 of Table \ref{regression_results}.

Figure \ref{fig:herring_iv} contains a scatterplot of real herring prices and landings, in 1000s of metric tons.   A  line representing equation \ref{eq:predicted_price}, which derived from the first columns of Table \ref{regression_results}, is also added. Data available after the Amendment 8 analysis is marked with triangles.

#### Results Overview

<!--
We present a box plot of discounted revenues over the 2021-2032 time period using a 3\% discount rate and a 7\% discount rate in figures \ref{fig:discounted_rev3} and  \ref{fig:discounted_rev7}. The line inside the box represents the median outcome.  The upper and lower boxes edges of the boxes are the 25th and 75th percentile of total revenue.  The "whiskers" give some idea of the undertainty outside the 25th and 75th percentile.  Wider whiskers indicate more uncertainty. The dots given some idea about the uncertainty outside even those whiskers. 

From the first two boxplots in Figure \ref{fig:discounted_rev3}, we find that the Alternative 2 (ABC CR) is likely to have lower revenues than Alternative 3 (Constant F) under baseline (average) recruitment. Alternative 2 is likely to have lower revenues under the Autocorrelated Recruitment and the "AR in AVG" scenarios as well.  Alternative 2 and 3 perform similarly in the "AVG in AR" scenario.  We discount at 3\% and 7\%.  Changes in the discount rate do not change the order of the scenarios.

\textcolor{blue}{Tables \ref{A2_summary} to \ref{A3A_summary} summarize the discounted gross revenue for Alternative 2 (ABC Control Rule) and Alternative 3 (Constant F). Only the AVG and AVG in AR recruitment scenarios are available for Altenative 3A.}  Under baseline recruitment and discounting (upper left cell of both tables), discounted gross revenues are approximately \$16M less under Alternative 2 compared to Alternative 3.  Changing the discount rate to 7\% reduces the difference to approximately \$13M (bottom left cells).  

Under autocorrelated recruitment, discounted gross revenues are approximately \$5M less under Alternative 2 compared to Alternative 3.  Changing the discount rate to 7\%, the difference between the two is still approximately \$5M.  

The ABC CR AR in AVG sensitivity analysis uses the same ABCs as derived from the ABC CR AR, so revenues in columns 2 and 3 of table \ref{A2_summary} are the same. The ABC CR AVG in AR sensitivity analysis uses the same ABCs as derived from the ABC CR, so revenues in columns 1 and 4 of \ref{A2_summary} are the same.   The same is true for table \ref{A3_summary}.

#### Alternatives 1 and 2

Alternatives 1 and 2 are expected to result in discounted gross revenues of approximately \$213 M over the 2021-2032 time period.  Sensitiviy analysis regarding the type of recruitment 

Figure \ref{fig:ABC_CR_traj} shows the time series trajectory of (non-discounted) revenues corresponding to the ABC CR. This provides some insight into the yearly projected fishing revenues.   The first year in which the Rebuilding F starts (2022) is marked with a vertical dashed line.

```


Table \ref{yearly_trajectoryA2} summarizes average revenue, by year, for Alternatives 2 along with the sensitivity analysis.  In all four plots, revenue decreases towards the end of the rebuilding period. This occurs because the ABC are above the 69,000mt critical point described in Section \ref{sec:prices}.

#### Alternative 3 \label{sec:A3_economic}
Alternative 3 is expected to result in discounted gross revenues of approximately \$228M over the 2021-2032 time period. Alternative 3 is expected to have moderate positive impacts on human communities relative to the Alternative 1. 

Figure \ref{fig:constant_traj} shows the time series trajectory of (non-discounted) revenues corresponding to the 7-year constant F rebuilding plan.  This provides some insight into the yearly projected fishing revenues and uncertainity about those projections. The first year the rebuilding plan (2022) is marked with a vertical dashed line.

#### Alternative 3A
Alternative 3A is expected to result in discounted gross revenues of approximately \$220M over the 2021-2032 time period. Alternative 3A is expected to have moderate positive impacts on human communities relative to the Alternative 1. 

Figure \ref{fig:lowerF_traj} shows the time series trajectory of (non-discounted) revenues corresponding to the 7-year lower F rebuilding plan.

### Action 2 - Overage AMs

Since 2009, there have been 11 overages of a sub-ACL, although only 3 have occurred in the last 5 years (Table \ref{tab:overages}).   Improvements to the quota monitoring system make overages less likely. ACLs for the entire fishery were not exceeded in any of these years. Low sub-ACLs (relative to the fleet's daily ability to catch herring) make in-season management that is designed to achieve, but not exceed a sub-ACL, logistically difficult.

<!-- this is so janky -->

```{r overages, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}
overages<-as.data.frame(rbind(c(2009,"1A", 43650, 44088,"1%"),c(2010,"1A", 26546, 28424,"7%"),c(2010,"1B", 4362, 6001,"38%"),c(2011,"1A", 29251,30676,"5%"),c(2012,"1B", 2723, 4307,"58%"),c(2012,"2", 22146, 22482,"2%"),c(2012,"3",  38146, 39471,"3%"),c(2014,"1B", 2878, 4399,"53%"),c(2016,"1B", 2844,  3657 ,"29%"),c(2019,"2", 4061 ,  4758 ,"17%"),c(2020,"1B", 483 ,  831 ,"72%")))

#overages[,1]<-as.numeric(as.character(overages[,1]))
overages[,3]<-as.numeric(as.character(overages[,3]))
overages[,4]<-as.numeric(as.character(overages[,4]))

colnames(overages)<-c("Year","Area", "sub-ACL", "Catch","Overage(%)")
knitr::kable(overages, "pipe", caption="Sub-ACL overages since 2009 \\label{tab:overages}",align="lrrrr", format.args = list(big.mark = ","))
```
The general approach to examining the impacts of these alternatives is to compute the change in revenues that would have been caused by the  overage deductions over the last five years.    In 2020, herring prices were approximately \$710 per metric ton (real 2019 USD); this is used to compute revenue.  3 overages have occurred in the last 5 years; total overage was 1,858mt.  

Under the *status quo* the 1,858mt overages are deducted from a future catch limit. Therefore, the overages would reduce fishery revenue by \$1.3M.  Because overages do not occur ever year, annual foregone revenues of approximately \$264,000 per year are expected. 

#### Alternative 1 -- no action
 Alternative 1 is the status quo; therefore, the expected changes in revenues, relative to the *status quo* are zero.

#### Alternative 2 - Allowance for overage up to 10\%
Alternative 2 would allow for overages of up to 10\% of a sub-ACL not to be deducted from future sub-ACLs unless the total catch is also greater than the ACL.  If this alternative had been in place over the 2016-2020 time period, the three overages would have resulted in reduction of 1,120mt to future catch limits.  This would have reduced fishery revenue by \$0.8M or \$160,000  per year.  Therefore, relative to the *status quo*, we expect approximately $160,000 in additional revenue per year to accrue to the fishery under the Alternative 2. 

Catch monitoring and in-season closures to the directed fishery would still be in place; this should limit the magnitude of any overages of a sub-ACLs.  Note that the positive impacts  are likely to accrue to users of areas that have gone over the ACLs; historical data suggest that this is likely to be Area 1B.  Area 1B sub-ACLs are often quite small relative to the capacity of vessels to catch herring.  This meams that in-season closures that are designed to meet, but not exceed a sub-ACL are difficult to implement. However, current low sub-ACLs for all areas make in-season quota monitoring more difficult and in the near term it is much more difficult to predict if which, if any, any sub-ACLs might be exceeded.



#### Alternative 3 - Allowance for overages until total ACL is harvested
Alternative 3 would allow for overages of a sub-ACL not to be deducted from future sub-ACLs unless the total catch is also greater than the ACL. If this alternative had been in place over the 2016-2020 time period, the three overages would have resulted in no reductions to future catch limits.  Therefore, relative to the status quo, approximately \$1.3M over this time period, or approximately $264,000 in additional revenue per year, is expcted to accrue to the fishery under the Alternative 2.  Note that catch monitoring and in-season closures to the directed fishery would still be in place; this limits the magnitude of any overages of sub-ACLs.

As with Alternative 2, positive impacts that are likely to accrue to users of areas that have gone over the ACLs; historical data suggest that this is likely to be Area 1B.  Area 1B sub-ACLs are often quite small relative to the capacity of vessels to catch herring.  This meams that in-season closures that are designed to meet, but not exceed a sub-ACL are difficult to implement. However, current low sub-ACLs for all areas make in-season quota monitoring more difficult and in the near term it is much more difficult to predict if which, if any, any sub-ACLs might be exceeded.

# Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis - Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis

The purpose of the RFA is to reduce the impacts of burdensome regulations and recordkeeping requirements on small businesses.  To achieve this goal, the RFA requires Federal agencies to describe and analyze the effects of proposed regulations, and possible alternatives, on small business entities.  To this end, this document contains an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA), found below, which includes an assessment of the effects that the Proposed Action and other alternatives are expected to have on small entities.

Under section 603(b) of the RFA, an IRFA must describe the impact of the proposed rule on small entities and contain the following information: 

1.	A description of the reasons why the action by the agency is being considered.
2.	A succinct statement of the objectives of, and legal basis for, the proposed rule.
3.	A description—and, where feasible, an estimate of the number—of small entities to which the proposed rule will apply.
4.	A description of the projected reporting, recordkeeping, and other compliance requirements of the proposed rule, including an estimate of the classes of small entities that will be subject to the requirement and the types of professional skills necessary for preparation of the report or record.
5.	 An identification, to the extent practicable, of all relevant federal rules that may duplicate, overlap, or conflict with the proposed rule.



## Reasons for Considering the Action

The purpose and need for this action are presented in section XX of this document. 

## Objectives and Legal Basis for the Action

The objectives for this action are presented in section XX of this document, and the legal basis is in section 8.0. 


## Description and Estimate of Small Entities to Which the Rule Applies

For RFA purposes only, NMFS has established a small business size standard for businesses, including their affiliates, whose primary industry is commercial fishing (see 50 CFR § 200.2).  A business primarily engaged in commercial fishing (NAICS code 11411) is classified as a small business if it is independently owned and operated, is not dominant in its field of operation (including its affiliates), and has combined annual receipts not in excess of $11 million for all its affiliated operations worldwide.

For the purposes of this analysis, entities (firms) are defined as collections of fishing vessels with identical ownership personnel.  For example, if five permits have the same seven people listed as co-owners on their application paperwork, those seven people  form one ownership entity, covering those five permits.  If any of the individual people own additional vessels, either by themselves, with new co-owners, or with a subset of the seven, those vessels are separate entities for the purpose of this analysis.

### Regulated Commercial Harvesting Entities

#### Tier 1 All Directly Regulated Fishing Firms

This rule would affect all vessels with permits to fish in the herring fisheries; therefore, the direct regulated entity is a firm that controls at least one herring permit.  Table \ref{RFA_characterization} describes the small and large directly regulated fishing entities.  A firm is included if it owned at least one category A, B, C, D, or E Herring Permit on July 1, 2021. Average revenue for each firm over the past three years (2018-2020) is summarized and used  to make a size determiniation.  There are 9 large entities and 1,213 small entities.

The 9 large entities earned a combined \$189M in fishing revenue (an average of approximately \$21M per firm) over the trailing three years.  Approximately \$2M (an average of approximately \$225,000) of that revenue was derived from herring.  The 1,213 small entities earned a combined $665M in fishing revenue (an average of approximately \$504,000 per firm).  Approximately \$11M (an average of approximately \$9,000) of that revenue was derived from herring.

  \end{center}
\end{table}

#### Tier 2 Directly Regulated Firms with a Limited Access Herring Permit
Many of the firms described in Table \ref{RFA_characterization} hold  *only* an (open-access) category D herring permit and no other herring permit.  Impacts of the proposed regulation are likely to be largest for the particpants in the directed fishery (holding at least one A, B, C, or E category permit).  Table \ref{RFA_characterization_ABCE} describes the directly regulated entities that hold at least one of these permits.   There are 6 Large Entities and  97 small entities that meet this criteria.

The 6 large entities earned a combined \$129M in fishing revenue (an average of approximately \$21.5M per firm) over the trailing three years.  Approximately \$2M (an average of approximately \$333,000) of that revenue was derived from herring.  The 97 small entities earned a combined $131M in fishing revenue (an average of approximately \$1.4M per firm).  Approximately \$11M (an average of approximately \$111,000 per firm) of that revenue was derived from herring.

  \end{center}
\end{table}

#### Tier 3 Active Directly Regulated Firms with a Limited Access Herring Permit

Some of the firms described in the previous section are not active in the herring fishery, despite controlling a Limited Access herring permit.  The "active, Limited Access" fishery, where active is defined as deriving any revenue from herring in 2020, is described in Table \ref{RFA_characterization_directed_active} .  There are 2 Large and 41 small entities that meet this criteria.  Because there are only two large entities, revenue statistics for this class are not presented.  The 41 active small entities earned a combined $37.3M in fishing revenue (an average of approximately \$910,000 per firm).  Approximately \$11M (an average of approximately \$260,000 per firm) of that revenue was derived from herring.

There were fewer than three large firms that derived revenue from herring in 2020, so these data are not presented \label{RFA_characterization_directed_active}}

## Record Keeping and Reporting Requirements

There are no additional record keeping or reporting requirements associated with this action.

## Duplication, Overlap, or Conflict with Other Federal Rules


## Impacts of the Proposed Rule on Small Entities

The proposed regulation would establish a rebuilding plan for herring and adopt the ABC control rule from Amendment 8 as the rebulding plan. Under the status quo, the fishery would be managed with the ABC control rule from Amendment 8.  Therefore, the rebuilding plan component of the proposed regulation would have no direct economic impacts on the small entities.  

The proposed regulation would also change the accountability measures in the herring fishery; allowing for up to 10\% overage of a sub-ACL before payback provisions reduce future sub-ACLs, provided the total ACL is not exceeded.  This is expected to increase This would have reduced fishery revenue by \$0.8M or \$160,000  per year.  Therefore, relative to the *status quo*, we expect approximately $160,000 in additional revenue per year to accrue to the fishery under the Alternative 2. 

In order to examine the effects of the proposed rule on small entities, we allocate the additional expected revenue to fishing firms in proportion to their share of the herring fishery over the trailing three years.  We then construct the change in gross reciepts, in both dollar and percentage terms, for each of the  firms.  This analysis assumes that fishing in the future in the "other fisheries" is similar to the 2018-2020 average and that proportional expansions or decreases at the firm level would occur relative to the 2018-2020 average. So, if a firm "exited" prior to 2018, it will not have any revenue if even if conditions improve.  

Table \ref{RFA_all_revenue_changes_all} illustrates the expected changes in receipts. Most of the additional revenue accrues to small firms; however, the increase in gross receipts from fishing is quite small in magnitude[^fn_inactive].  

[^fn_inactive]:Because of the way additional revenue is allocated to the firms, the gross reciepts of the inactive firms cannot increase.

## Impacts of the non-preferred measures on Small Entities
While The economic analysis of section \ref{sec:A3_economic} suggests that Action 1, Alternative 3, in combination with the preferred AM alternative, would result in higher net benefits (or lower cost) to small entities.  


# E.O. 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review)
The purpose of E.O 12866 is to enhance planning and coordination with respect to new and existing regulations.  This E.O. requires the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to review regulatory programs that are considered to be “significant.”  E.O. 12866 requires a review of proposed regulations to determine whether or not the expected effects would be significant, where a significant action is any regulatory action that may:

* Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities;
*	Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;
*	Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or
*	Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President’s priorities, of the principles set forth in the Executive Order.

In deciding how whether and how to regulate, agencies should assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives, include the alternative of not regulating.  Costs and benefits shall be understood to include both quantifiable measures (to the fullest extent that these can be usefully estimated) and qualitative measures of costs and benefits that are difficult to quantify, but nevertheless essential to consider.

## Statement of the Problem/Goals and Objectives

Problem, goals, and objectives are explained in Section *YYY* 

## Management Alternatives and Rationale

The alternatives under consideration in this Framework are explained in Section *YYY*

## Description of the Fishery

A description of the fishery is available in Section *YYY*

## Summary of Impacts
The expected economics effects (benefits/costs) of the preferred alternative for  Action 1 and 2, relative to the no action baseline for the herring fishery, are discussed throughout Sections Y  and Z  of this document. Action 1 has no economic impacts on the directed herring fishery; the ABC control rule selected for rebuilding is identical to the ABC control rule currently in place. 

The Atlantic herring fishery is overfished; however, overfishing is not occurring. A rebuilding plan must be developed and implemented within two years (by October, 2022).  If the proposed regulations are not implemented by then, the herring fishery management plan would not be in compliance with the MSFCMA as of that date. This is likely to result in costly litigation; the remedy of the deficiency would be to consider and develop a rebuilding plan. 
Due to slightly higher catches, an increase in revenue of approximately $160,000 per year is expected to accrue to the participants in the herring fishery.  Due to slightly higher catches, *de minimus* negative effects on the herring stock are expected.  The preferred alternative for Action 2 would not increase catch above ACLs and is not expected to have an impact on future stock status.




## Determination of Significance
<!--
I now think it's not a significant regulatory action.
-->

Based on the analyses provided in this document, the proposed regulation is not expected to constitute a “significant regulatory action.”  This action is not expected to have an impact of $100M or more on the economy, or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities.  They are not expected to raise novel legal and policy issues.  The proposed action also does not interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency.  It does not materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs, or the rights and obligations of recipients.
