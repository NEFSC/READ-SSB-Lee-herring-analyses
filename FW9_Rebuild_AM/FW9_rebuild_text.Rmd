## Impacts on Human Communities

### Action 1 - Rebuilding Plan
The general approach used in this analysis is to describe the discounted projected revenues under the different rebuilding alternatives and sensitivity to different recruitment assumptions. To do this, we:

1.  Use the projected ABCs described in section 6.1.  When ABCs are higher than the highest observed US catch (124,100 mt in 1997), we set catch to this amount. Otherise, we assume landings are equal to the ABC.  Ideally, this simulation would be a closed-loop simulation and the stock projections would account for the possiblity that catch would be less than the ABC. 
1.  Simulate predicted prices (in Real 2019 dollars) corresponding to that level of landings. 
1.  Multiply price by landings to construct revenue.
1.  Discount by 7\% or 3\% per year as mandated by OMB Circular A-4.
1.  Sum up the discounted yearly revenue.


We assume that the maximum catch is 124,100mt.  This is reasonable in this analysis because the industry is unlikely to expand capacity above the highest historical level in the short run. However, if high ABCs persist it is likely that capacity will also increase.  

A projection of ABCs under Alterative 1 is difficult. As described in section 4.1.1, NEFMC would continue to use the ABC control rule to set fishery specifications two years at a time.  We assume this would produce the same set of ABCs as Alternative 2.

#### Prices

<!-- 
D asked for a less technical overview of this 
-->


We estimate a Instrumental Variables regression using annual herring landings and prices from 2003-2020.   We normalize to 2019 real US dollars using the GDP implicit price deflator.  A least-squares regression will be produce biased estimates if prices and quantities are simultaneously determined.  An Instrumental Variables estimator, where previous year's landings is used as an instrument for landings, can overcome this problem.

Table \ref{regression_results} contains the results of the IV estimator and least squares estimator.  We also estimate a pair of log-transformed models. The first column is the preferred specification and used for predictions. The other three columns are presented as robustness checks.  The landings coefficient from the IV model in Table \ref{regression_results} implies that, on average, an increase in landings of 1,000 mt will reduce prices by \$5.89 per metric ton. The log-landings coefficient from the IV model is an elasticity and implies that an increase in landings of 1\% will reduce prices by 0.44\%.

The methods used to model prices are slighly different that those used in Deroba *et al* (2019).  In Deroba *et al* (2019), an autoregressive distributed lag model was used.  The authors find that the an increase in landings of 1,000 mt will reduce prices by \$1.19 per metric to; alternatively, an increase in landings of 1\% will reduce prices by 0.395\%.  We note that the elasticity estimates in Deroba *et al* (2019) are comparable to elasticities in Table \ref{regression_results}.  However, the marginal effects are quite different. 

In Amendment 8, an elasticity of -0.50 was assumed. By coincidence, this assumption turned out to be fairly close to both the estimates in Deroba *et al* (2019) and the estimates in columns 3 and 4 of Table \ref{regression_results}.

#### Results Overview

<!--
We present a box plot of discounted revenues over the 2021-2032 time period using a 3\% discount rate and a 7\% discount rate in figures \ref{fig:discounted_rev3} and  \ref{fig:discounted_rev7}. The line inside the box represents the median outcome.  The upper and lower boxes edges of the boxes are the 25th and 75th percentile of total revenue.  The "whiskers" give some idea of the undertainty outside the 25th and 75th percentile.  Wider whiskers indicate more uncertainty. The dots given some idea about the uncertainty outside even those whiskers. 

From the first two boxplots in Figure \ref{fig:discounted_rev3}, we find that the Alternative 2 (ABC CR) is likely to have lower revenues than Alternative 3 (Constant F) under baseline (average) recruitment. Alternative 2 is likely to have lower revenues under the Autocorrelated Recruitment and the "AR in AVG" scenarios as well.  Alternative 2 and 3 perform similarly in the "AVG in AR" scenario.  We discount at 3\% and 7\%.  Changes in the discount rate do not change the order of the scenarios.
\newpage

You have to do eval=FALSE to code snippets, even if they are in an html comment.
```{r discounted_rev3, fig.show = "hold", out.width = "75%", fig.cap="Boxplots of discounted (3\\%) Herring Revenue",  fig.align = "center", echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(my_images,c("boxplot_discounted_rev3.png")))
```


```{r discounted_rev7, fig.show = "hold", out.width = "75%", fig.cap="Boxplots of discounted (7\\%) Herring Revenue",  fig.align = "center", echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(my_images,c("boxplot_discounted_rev7.png")))
```

-->


Tables \ref{A2_summary} and \ref{A3_summary} summarize the discounted gross revenue for Alternative 2 (ABC Control Rule) and Alternative 3 (Constant F). Under baseline recruitment and discounting (upper left cell of both tables), discounted gross revenues are approximately \$17M less under Alternative 2 compared to Alternative 3.  Changing the discount rate to 7\% reduces the difference to approximately \$15M (bottom left cells).  Under two alternative recruitment and management assumptions (AR and AR in AVG) the magnitude of the difference between the two alternatives changes.  Alternative 2 produces higher revenues than Alternative 3 by approximately \$7M in the AVG in AR recruitment scenario.

#### Alternatives 1 and 2

Alternatives 1 and 2 are expected to result in discounted gross revenues of approximately \$200 M over the 2021-2032 time period.  

Figure \ref{fig:ABC_CR_traj} shows the time series trajectory of (non-discounted) revenues corresponding to the ABC CR. This provides some insight into the yearly projected fishing revenues and uncertainity about those projections. The first year the rebuilding plan (2022) is marked with a vertical dashed line. 
*NOTE for Deirdre/Rachel: I'm not quite sure why the AR in AVG and AVG in AR projections have differences for the 2020 and 2021 fishing years.  I would have thought they would have the same ABCs (the 2020 and 2021 actuals).  I don't think this causes much of a change in the results.  Particularly since it's the same for Alt 3.  But something to be aware of. *

#### Alternative 3 
Alternative 3 is expected to result in discounted gross revenues of approximately \$217MM over the 2021-2032 time period. Alternative 3 is expected to have moderate positive impacts on human communities relative to the Alternative 1. 

Figure \ref{fig:constant_traj} shows the time series trajectory of (non-discounted) revenues corresponding to the 7-year constant F rebuilding plan.  This provides some insight into the yearly projected fishing revenues and uncertainity about those projections. The first year the rebuilding plan (2022) is marked with a vertical dashed line.

### Action 2 - Overage AMs

Since 2009, there have been 11 overages of a sub-ACL, although only 3 have occurred in the last 5 years.  Improvements to the quota monitoring system make overages less likely.  See Table \ref{fig:overages}.  ACLs for the entire fishery were not exceeded in any of these years. Low sub-ACLs (relative to the fleet's daily ability to catch herring) make in-season management that is designed to achieve, but not exceed a sub-ACL, logistically difficult.



```{r overages, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}
tabl <- "
| Year  | Area   | sub-ACL  | Catch| Overage(%)|
|-------|--------|------:|-----:|-----:|
| 2009| 1A|43,650|44,088|1%
| 2010| 1A|26,546|28,424|7%
| 2010| 1B|4,362|6,001|38%
| 2011| 1A|29,251|30,676|5%
| 2012| 1B|2,723|4,307|58%
| 2012| 2|22,146|22,482|2%
| 2012| 3| 38,146|39,471|3%
| 2014| 1B|2,878|4,399|53%
| 2016| 1B |2,844 | 3,657 | 29%
| 2019| 2 |4,061 | 4,758 |17%
| 2020| 1B |483 | 831 |72%
"
cat(tabl)
```
The general approach to examining the impacts of these alternatives is to compute the change in revenues that would have been caused by the  overage deductions over the last five years.    In 2020, herring prices were approximately \$710 per metric ton (real 2019 USD); this is used to compute revenue.  3 overages have occurred in the last 5 years; total overage was 1,858mt.  

Under the *status quo* the 1,858mt overages are deducted from a future catch limit. Therefore, the overages would reduce fishery revenue by \$1.3M.  Because overages do not occur ever year, we expect annual foregone revenues of approximately \$264,000 per year. 

#### Alternative 1 -- no action
 Alternative 1 is the status quo; therefore, the expected changes in revenues, relative to the *status quo* are zero.

#### Alternative 2 - Allowance for overage up to 10\%
Alternative 2 would allow for overages of up to 10\% of a sub-ACL not to be deducted from future sub-ACLs unless the total catch is also greater than the ACL.  If this alternative had been in place over the 2016-2020 time period, the three overages would have resulted in reduction of 1,120mt to future catch limits.  This would have reduced fishery revenue by \$0.8M or \$160,000  per year.  Therefore, relative to the *status quo*, we expect approximately $104,000 in additional revenue per year to accrue to the fishery under the Alternative 2. 

Catch monitoring and in-season closures to the directed fishery would still be in place; this should limit the magnitude of any overages of a sub-ACLs.  We also note that the positive impacts  are likely to accrue to users of areas that have gone over the ACLs; historical data suggest that this is likely to be Area 1B.  Area 1B sub-ACLs are often quite small relative to the capacity of vessels to catch herring.  This meams that in-season closures that are designed to meet, but not exceed a sub-ACL are difficult to implement. However, current low sub-ACLs for all areas make in-season quota monitoring more difficult and in the near term it is much more difficult to predict if which, if any, any sub-ACLs might be exceeded.



#### Alternative 3 - Allowance for overages until total ACL is harvested
Alternative 3 would allow for overages of a sub-ACL not to be deducted from future sub-ACLs unless the total catch is also greater than the ACL. If this alternative had been in place over the 2016-2020 time period, the three overages would have resulted in no reductions to future catch limits.  Therefore, relative to the status quo, we expect approximately \$1.3M over this time period, or approximately $264,000 in additional revenue per year to accrue to the fishery under the Alternative 2.  Note that catch monitoring and in-season closures to the directed fishery would still be in place; this limits the magnitude of any overages of sub-ACLs.

As with Alternative 2, positive impacts that are likely to accrue to users of areas that have gone over the ACLs; historical data suggest that this is likely to be Area 1B.  Area 1B sub-ACLs are often quite small relative to the capacity of vessels to catch herring.  This meams that in-season closures that are designed to meet, but not exceed a sub-ACL are difficult to implement. However, current low sub-ACLs for all areas make in-season quota monitoring more difficult and in the near term it is much more difficult to predict if which, if any, any sub-ACLs might be exceeded.

# Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis - Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis

The purpose of the RFA is to reduce the impacts of burdensome regulations and recordkeeping requirements on small businesses.  To achieve this goal, the RFA requires Federal agencies to describe and analyze the effects of proposed regulations, and possible alternatives, on small business entities.  To this end, this document contains an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA), found below, which includes an assessment of the effects that the Proposed Action and other alternatives are expected to have on small entities.

Under section 603(b) of the RFA, an IRFA must describe the impact of the proposed rule on small entities and contain the following information: 

1.	A description of the reasons why the action by the agency is being considered.
2.	A succinct statement of the objectives of, and legal basis for, the proposed rule.
3.	A description—and, where feasible, an estimate of the number—of small entities to which the proposed rule will apply.
4.	A description of the projected reporting, recordkeeping, and other compliance requirements of the proposed rule, including an estimate of the classes of small entities that will be subject to the requirement and the types of professional skills necessary for preparation of the report or record.
5.	 An identification, to the extent practicable, of all relevant federal rules that may duplicate, overlap, or conflict with the proposed rule.



## Reasons for Considering the Action

The purpose and need for this action are presented in section XX of this document. 

## Objectives and Legal Basis for the Action

The objectives for this action are presented in section XX of this document, and the legal basis is in section 8.0. 


## Description and Estimate of Small Entities to Which the Rule Applies

For RFA purposes only, NMFS has established a small business size standard for businesses, including their affiliates, whose primary industry is commercial fishing (see 50 CFR § 200.2).  A business primarily engaged in commercial fishing (NAICS code 11411) is classified as a small business if it is independently owned and operated, is not dominant in its field of operation (including its affiliates), and has combined annual receipts not in excess of $11 million for all its affiliated operations worldwide.

For the purposes of this analysis, entities (firms) are defined as collections of fishing vessels with identical ownership personnel.  For example, if five permits have the same seven people listed as co-owners on their application paperwork, those seven people  form one ownership entity, covering those five permits.  If any of the individual people own additional vessels, either by themselves, with new co-owners, or with a subset of the seven, those vessels are separate entities for the purpose of this analysis.

### Regulated Commercial Harvesting Entities
This rule would affect all vessels with permits to fish in the herring fisheries; therefore, the direct regulated entity is a firm that owns at least one herring permit.  

Table \ref{RFA_characterization} describes the small and large directly regulated entities.  A firm is included if it owned at least one category A, B, C, D, or E Herring Permit on July 1, 2021. We summarize the average revenue for each firm over the past three years (2018-2020) and use this to make a size determiniation.  There are 9 Large Entities and 1,213 small entities.

The 9 large entities earned a combined \$189M in fishing revenue (an average of approximately \$21M per firm) over the trailing three years.  Approximately \$2M (an average of approximately \$225,000) of that revenue was derived from herring.  The 1,213 small entities earned a combined $665M in fishing revenue (an average of approximately \$504,000 per firm).  Approximately \$11M (an average of approximately \$9,000) of that revenue was derived from herring.


\begin{table}[htbp]
  \begin{center}
  \begin{scriptsize}
    \input{./tables/RFA_small_large_firms.tex}
  \end{scriptsize}
    \caption{A characterization of the Small and Large firms.  Revenue figures represent aggregate revenue for the small and large classes of firms, averaged over the 2018-2020 time period and are in  millions of nominal US Dollars. \label{RFA_characterization}}
  \end{center}
\end{table}


Many of the firms described in table \ref{RFA_characterization} hold  *only* a category D herring permit and no other herring permit.  Impacts of the proposed regulation are likely to be largest for the particpants in the directed fishery (holding at least one A, B, C, or E category permit).  Table \ref{RFA_characterization_ABCE} describes the directly regulated entities that hold at least one of these permits.   There are 6 Large Entities and  97 small entities that meet this criteria.

The 6 large entities earned a combined \$129M in fishing revenue (an average of approximately \$21.5M per firm) over the trailing three years.  Approximately \$2M (an average of approximately \$333,000) of that revenue was derived from herring.  The 97 small entities earned a combined $131M in fishing revenue (an average of approximately \$1.4M per firm).  Approximately \$11M (an average of approximately \$111,000 per firm) of that revenue was derived from herring.

  \end{center}
\end{table}


Finally, we describe the "active and directed" fishery, defining active as deriving any revenue from herring in 2020 in Table \ref{RFA_characterization_directed_active} .  There are 2 Large and 41 small entities that meet this criteria.  Because there are only two large entities, revenue statistics for this class are not presented.  The 41 active small entities earned a combined $37.3M in fishing revenue (an average of approximately \$910,000 per firm).  Approximately \$11M (an average of approximately \$260,000 per firm) of that revenue was derived from herring.

Revenue figures represent aggregate revenue for the small classes of firms, averaged over the 20018-2020 time period and are in millions of nominal US Dollars.  There were fewer than three large firms that derived revenue from herring in 2020, so these data are not presented \label{RFA_characterization_directed_active}}
  \end{center}
\end{table}

## Record Keeping and Reporting Requirements

There are no additional record keeping or reporting requirements associated with this action.

## Duplication, Overlap, or Conflict with Other Federal Rules


## Impacts of the Proposed Rule on Small Entities


<!-- 

Action 1 (Rebuilding) 
   **No action is the ABC control rule? Which means no action is pretty similar to the rebuilding plan??**  

Action 2 (AMs)  are likely to have a minimal impact on fishing firms. 
 -->
General Approach
<!-- \analysis\RFA\FW9_RFAanalysis_projections.do -->
1.  Compute affiliate's average revenue, average herring revenue, and average non-herring revenue for trailing 3 years.
1.  Compute affiliate's fraction of herring fishery (herring rev divided by all herring rev).
1.  Construct affiliate's projected herring revenue by multiplying fleetwide revenue (from previous section) by affiliate's fraction of herring fishery
1.  Construct affiliate's revenue and the change in revenue, relative to 2018-2020 average.

This assumes that fishing in the future in the "other fisheries" is similar to the 2018-2020 average.  We also are assuming proportional expansions or decreases at the firm level relative to the 2018-2020 average. So, if a firm "exited" prior to 2018, it will not have any revenue if even if conditions improve.  

<!--Not sure of best way to summarize these.  Discounted total revenues.  And then do means/median/percentiles (across individuals) for large and small. Everything can be evaluated relative to no action.-->

<!--Do we want to filter on just "active" in 2020 to match the entities description? Or just leave it the way it is.-->


# E.O. 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review)
The purpose of E.O 12866 is to enhance planning and coordination with respect to new and existing regulations.  This E.O. requires the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to review regulatory programs that are considered to be “significant.”  E.O. 12866 requires a review of proposed regulations to determine whether or not the expected effects would be significant, where a significant action is any regulatory action that may:

* Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities;
*	Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;
*	Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or
*	Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President’s priorities, of the principles set forth in the Executive Order.

In deciding how whether and how to regulate, agencies should assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives, include the alternative of not regulating.  Costs and benefits shall be understood to include both quantifiable measures (to the fullest extent that these can be usefully estimated) and qualitative measures of costs and benefits that are difficult to quantify, but nevertheless essential to consider.

## Statement of the Problem/Goals and Objectives

Problem, goals, and objectives are explained in Section *YYY* 

## Management Alternatives and Rationale

The alternatives under consideration in this Framework are explained in Section *YYY*

## Description of the Fishery

A description of the fishery is available in Section *YYY*


## Summary of Impacts
The expected economics effects (benefits/costs) of each the Action 1 and 2, relative to the no action baseline for the herring fishery, are discussed throughout Sections Y  and Z  of this document. Action 2 is expected to have minimal impacts on the fishery, so we focus on Action 1.

Section Z describes the expected benefits to the participants in the directed herring fishery. Due to slightly higher catches, *de minimus* negative effects on the herring stock are expected.  However, Alternative 2/3 of Action 2 would not increase catch above ACLs, it is not expected to have an impact on stock status.

<!-- To summarize, the proposed regulation is expected to result in gross revenues that are approximately XX% percent lower than the no action alternative. 

Both policies result in similar resource conditions in 2032 under the baseline recruitment scenario, although using the ABC Control Rule is expected to result in faster rebuilding of the herring stock.  In the autocorrelated recruitment scenario, the ABC Control Rule is expected to result in slower rebuilding.  In the AVG in AR scenario, neither the ABC conrol rule not the constant F policy are expected to achieve rebuilding. And in the AR in AVG scenario, both are expected to rebuild in the same year.  Other stock metrics (P-Rebuild and SSB in 2032) are very similar for both Alternatives.

Scenario|Recruitment  |		SSB_in_2032|	Rebuild year|	P Rebuild in 2032|
ABC CR|	BASE|	293798|	2026|	0.61|
7 yr cons|	BASE|	292429|	2028|	0.603|

-->

## Determination of Significance
<!--
Not sure about this yet. I've copied it in from FW8, in case this is true.  It's looking like not a significant regulatory action.

Based on the analyses provided in this document, the proposed regulation is not expected to constitute a “significant regulatory action.”  This action is not expected to have an impact of $100M or more on the economy, or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities.  They are not expected to raise novel legal and policy issues.  The proposed action also does not interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency.  It does not materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs, or the rights and obligations of recipients.
